# Project Description
Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) ) there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that you'll encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the development activities over the last 13 years.
